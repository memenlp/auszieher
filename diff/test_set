My wife loves the speed of the processor, huge storage
The graphics are poor and they have a lot of apps that do not even work with flagship phones.
Absolutely love the \"live\" heart rate monitoring and the ability to see average HR in the Garmin Connect app.
the only reason I give it 4 stars vs 5 is the lack of touch screen functionality.

Hi Slim, love watching your video's, your voice is calming to listen too. ðŸ˜Š
we enjoyed watching this video from site 1 @ Santee   coastal reserve, making the 700 mile trip from Pa.
Easily able to control both my Flashpoint and Godox strobes!
They really cheapened out, you have no choice except to buy a replacement.
I am glad you enjoyed your trip
I like it but it's not a high quality picture.
Always enjoy your videos and it was great to have you share your Snowbird adventure including the pros and cons.
man i feel so sad for these worn out, wet and bedraggled little buggies
Make this a series I love it
It is good you got back safely and only had a few minor problems.

Good job on patching it up and getting it going again
building high-quality topic models can be time consuming and involve a significant amount of manual verification and model refinement
Good that Airpods get its own menu

Tim Cook and Apple are hypocrites, clearly caring little about the world and/or human rights, only profitability
My most appreciated   feature is the Haptic keyboard.
I am most excited for bio-metric password
most of the banking appâ€™s doesnâ€™t work for me after the update
The new FaceID unlock on my 13ProMax is great
Very nice that it adds automatic punctation
The fact that Logitech never bothered to upgrade their Brio 4k only because of their complacency nothing else
Amazing for streamers, they'll buy tons of these, but $300.
I am impressed with the insta360 as well
It is bug.
I like that they improved the sharing of wifi password.
You dont know how happy i am that they used inches for tube sized sensors, and mm for film size,
Love watching these types of videos
